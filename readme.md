# TODOs
* Running a sequence of commands off of a pattern match should terminate if one of the commands fails
* There should be a very visible line break between invocations
  * With timestamp, exit code, nice data about what happened
* By default it should reinjest Hctawfile on edits
* Restart task if another event comes in (configurable?)
* Print data like exit code and time run
* Add some hotkeys to do stuff like rerun with one key-press
  * Key bindings in config as well
* Make piping to view work
* superivise/Interrupt processes (for stuff like that almost ide for haskell)
* Reverse file format, one command, multiple globs
